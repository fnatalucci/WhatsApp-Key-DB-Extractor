# WhatsApp Key/DB Extractor v2

The purpose of this script is to provide a method for WhatsApp users to extract their cipher key on NON-ROOTED
Android devices. The cipher key is required to decrypt WhatsApp CRYPT6 and CRYPT7 backup files. This script
works by hooking into the USB backup feature on Android 4.0 or higher. It will NOT work with earlier Android
versions or on devices where this feature has been deliberately disabled by the manufacturer. The cipher key
can be used with WhatCrypt (www.whatcrypt.com), both on the website (online decryption / exportation) and with
the Android App (offline decryption / recryption). Other apps and websites may also support WhatsApp cipher keys.
It should be noted that WhatsApp cipher keys can roll (update) periodically. If this happens then you will need
to repeat the instructions contained within this file in order to extract the latest cipher key. This script will
also extract the latest UNENCRYPTED WhatsApp Message Database (`msgstore.db`) and Contacts Database (`wa.db`).

In addition to the above. A copy of the cipher key will also be pushed to the WhatsApp Database directory on the
device itself and contained within a file called `.nomedia`. The reason for this is to allow Android Developers
a unified method in which they can offer their app users WhatsApp Decryption for those willing to run this script.
